Memory Game
Welcome to the Memory Game repository! This project is a fun and interactive card-matching game where players attempt to match pairs of cards. The game includes a timer, move counter, and stars for scoring. It's a simple game designed for users of all ages, and it's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Card Matching: Match pairs of cards by flipping them over.
Timer: A timer tracks how long it takes to complete the game.
Move Counter: Keeps track of the number of moves made.
Star Rating: Based on performance, a star rating system is used to give feedback.
Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive and works across devices from desktops to mobile screens.
Modal Popup: Upon winning, a modal displays the total time, number of moves, and a "Play Again" option.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used for the structure of the game, including cards and modal.
CSS: Used for styling the cards, modal, and overall layout.
JavaScript: The core logic of the game, including handling events, timer, and card matching.
How to Play
Start by clicking any card to flip it.
Try to match it with another card of the same type.
Once all pairs are matched, the game will show a modal displaying your time and number of moves.
You can start a new game by clicking the "Play Again" button in the modal.
AI Assistance
The README file for this project was created with the assistance of an AI, which helped in structuring and providing descriptions. However, the game logic and design were developed entirely by me.
